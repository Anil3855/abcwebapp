CloudWatch (Monitoring Service)
-------------------------------
Step1 : Create two EC2 machines
        Name it as 1. Machine-1
                   2. Machine-2

Monitorig tab, helps you get the cloudWatch metrics like
1. CPU Utilization
2. Disk read (Bytes)
3. Disk write (Bytes)
4. Network packets in
5. Network packets out etc

This metics will be update every 5 mints.

What is detailed monitoring ?
we get the metrics for every one min (its paid service)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets go to cloudwatch dashboard.

Services -->Management and Governance -->cloudwatch
select Metrics --> EC2
we can see all merics available.

Select the required Machine and matrics, so that we can monitor.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Setting up an Alarm, to take the action.

Topic Name: TEST_TOPIC
Alarm Name: My_alarm2

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
How to set billing Alarm?

Goto My Account --> Billing Preferences --> Select receive bill Alerts.

In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, create Alarm.

choose Select metric. In the all metrics tab, choose Billing Total Estimated Change.

Select the check box next to EstimatedChanges, and choose Select metric.

under Conditions, choose Static.

For whenever Estimatedcharges is , choose Greater.

For than, Enter the monetary amount (for example, 10) that must be exceeded to trigger the alarm.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Delection process
------------------
1. Delete Alarm
2. Terminate EC2 Machine.

Cloud Trail
============
its an auditing service.

In IAM, we have learnt how to create users, Groups,Assign user to groups etc.

lets say, someone has deleted S3 bucket?
How to know, which users has done this?
At what time, its has happened?
We can track this information using cloudTrail.
All the activities can be tracked by user using cloudTrail.

Services -- CloudTrail
select event history

Observation: We can see the records of the events which we have performed.

Select a particular event, we can get more detail information.

We can apply filters
Filter: Resource type Bucket
We can see the events related to the se Bucket

We can apply filter based on time period
We can download the list of events.

Note: Root user can see the event history.
IAM : user will not have access to see the event history.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cloud Formation
================
3 ways to create AWS infrastructure 
1. GUI    (console)
2. CLI    ( command line Interface)
3. IAAC   ( Infrastructure as a code : CloudFormation, Terraform)

Code is written in JSON/Yaml Script
When we run the code infrastructure will be created.

Advantages:
-----------
We can store the code in S3 for repeated execution
We can have version controlling

Praticals:
----------
Services --> Management and Governance --> CloudFormation
Create Stack --> Create Template in Designer
Select Template tab (Select YAML radio button)
Under Resource Types --> EC2 -->EC2 fleet --> Drag and Drop in the right side frame.
We get the YAML Code

--------------------
Lets Goback and select sample template
Select LAMP Stack -- (select view in designer to see the code -- newtab)
Next -- Stack Name --Mystack
        DB Password - welcome
        DBRootPassword - welcome
        DBUsername     - welcome
        keyname        - cf

Next --> Tags --> Name: LAMP Stack -->Next -->create Stack

(We should able to see Webserver, Security group.
 in webserver, PHP and MySQL will be installed)

------------------------
Goto Services -->EC2, we can see one EC2 machine gets created.
Goto Security Group - One Security Group is also Created.

-----------------------
In stack Details dashboard -- outputs
We get website URL (This is nothing but DNS name to the EC2 Machine)
open the URL
We get the default website.

========================================================================================

What is Terraform?
Its similar for CloudFormation.
By using terraform , we can create AWS / Azure / GCP infrastructure.

----------------
Deletion Process
----------------
Delete the Stack, Complete infrastructure gets deleted.
(EC2 Machine is Terminated , Security group is also deleted)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Elastic Beanstalk
------------------
Mainly used by Developers
Developers write the code for creating application.
For testing the code , Developers needs Machine (EC2 instance)

Developers are not inclined/ preffered to create infrastructure.
The solution for developers is ElasticBeanstalk.

Developer write the code, they upload the code into ElasticBeanStalk.
Infrastructure wil be created automatically for testing the application.

objective of cloudFormation is to Create Infrastructure
Objective to ElasticBeanstalk is to test the Application

Praticals:
------------
Service --> Compute --> Elastic Beanstalk
Get started
Application Name - MyApp
platform - PHP

Select Sample Application:
--------------------------
Create Application (it will take few min) Hit refresh in EC2 dashboard
EC2 Machine is created , Code will be Deployed into the EC2 Machine
Observation: Security group will also be created with the Application Name.

How we can see the website,
In MyApp dashboard -- we get environment ID and Application URL

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Deleting The application
In all Application
Action -- Delete Application
Automatically EC2 and Security Groups will be deleted.

Snowball
----------
It is a data migration Service.

Lets say, you have 1TB of data.
You need to migrate 1TB Data to S3 bucket.
Assume, it takes 1hr time to migrate.

If the data is 100 TB?
If the data is 1000 TB  (1 zeta byte)
If the data is 100 ZB ?
If the data is 1000 ZB ? (peta byte)
If the data is 100 PB - it takes years to load the data.

Ex: Facebook, will have huge amount of data 
The solution, is snowball
There are tree variants in snowball
1. snowball
2. snowball edge
3. snowball mobile

1. Snowball:
---------------
its physical hard disk, AWS will send to the client location.
The Size of the snowball will be 80 TB

Search in google "aws snowball" we can see the image of the snowball.

2. Snowball edge:
-----------------
The Size is 100 TB
Snowball edge contains compute capacity.
It comes with display (similar to mobile phone)
We can edit, delete from the display.

Usecase: National Geographic Channel
will take snowball edge to forest shoots etc

Search in Google "AWS snowball edge"

3. snow mobile:
---------------
The size is 100 PB
its like truck.
Search in google "aws snowball mobile"
